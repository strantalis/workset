# Workset

![Workset](assets/workset.png)

Workset is a Go CLI for managing multi-repo workspaces with linked worktrees by default. It makes multi-repo operations predictable, safe, and fast.

## What you get

- Workspaces that track intent across repos.
- Linked worktrees for isolation without duplication.
- Explicit base/write remotes for forks.
- Templates for repeatable repo bundles.

## Next up

Branch create/checkout and worktree lifecycle commands are next in the roadmap.
